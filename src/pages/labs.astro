          Build delivery systems teams depend on — not coordination they forget.
        </p>
        <div class="text-lg text-[#1a1a1a] leading-relaxed text-left space-y-5">
          <p>Most Agile roles quietly become coordination roles.</p>
          <p>Reminders. Status checks. Meeting follow-ups. Manual reporting.</p>
          <p>Work moves forward because someone keeps pushing it forward.</p>
          <p>
            At first, that makes you helpful.
            Over time, it makes you necessary — but not scalable.
          </p>
          <p>
            And when organizations change, roles tied only to coordination are
            the first ones questioned.
          </p>
          <p>The Agile Architecture Lab exists for a different path.</p>
          <p>Instead of managing work, you learn how to design how work moves.</p>
          <p>
            You learn how automation, communication flow, and reporting
            structures combine into a delivery system that operates reliably —
            even when you are not personally supervising every step.
          </p>
          <p>This is not about becoming a developer.</p>
          <p>
            It is about becoming the person who understands how delivery actually
            functions inside an organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            You stop being the person who runs the process.
            You become the person who designed the process.

      <section class="space-y-6 mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#294bf3]">
          What This Actually Changes For You
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Many Agile professionals quietly feel a shift happening.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Teams still run standups and retros — but the real decisions are
          increasingly driven by systems, data, and automation. Organizations
          rely less on coordination and more on operational infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When your value comes from manually keeping work moving, your role
          depends on constant effort and presence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          That works — until leadership asks a different question:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-[#294bf3] bg-[#f0f7ff] pl-6 py-4 pr-4 rounded-r-lg">
          <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl italic text-[#1a1a1a] leading-relaxed">
            "Why does this process require a person at all?"
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The professionals who grow are not the ones who manage the workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          They are the ones who design the workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Agile Architecture Lab teaches you how to become the person who
          defines how delivery operates — not the person responsible for
          chasing it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This is the difference between:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg pl-6 list-disc marker:text-[#294bf3]">
          <li>maintaining a role</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">and</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg pl-6 list-disc marker:text-[#294bf3]">
          <li>becoming difficult to replace</li>

          What You'll Build Inside the Lab
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Inside the Lab you do not just learn individual automations. You learn
          how they combine into a repeatable delivery system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">You will implement:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg pl-6 list-disc marker:text-[#294bf3]">
          <li>sprint lifecycle automation</li>
          <li>stakeholder communication structures</li>
          <li>automated status visibility</li>
          <li>reporting workflows that generate themselves</li>
          <li>escalation safeguards for stalled work</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The goal is not more tools.</p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The goal is a delivery process that runs predictably.
        </p>

      <!-- Who This Is For -->
      <section class="space-y-6 mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#294bf3]">Who This Is For</h2>
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg pl-6 list-disc marker:text-[#294bf3]">
          <li>Scrum Masters tired of manual coordination</li>
          <li>Individual contributors seeking technical leverage</li>
          <li>Agile practitioners responsible for visibility and reporting</li>
          <li>Professionals who want durable, repeatable processes</li>

      <!-- Where This Fits -->
      <section class="space-y-6 mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#294bf3]">Where this fits</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          You do not need to complete the Sprint Automation Kit to join the Lab.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Lab focuses on how delivery systems are designed and operated. The
          Automation Kit simply introduces some of the individual building
          blocks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Some members start with the kit. Others begin directly inside the Lab
          and learn the components as they go.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          If you are comfortable following step-by-step walkthroughs and
          implementing processes in your team environment, you are ready to
          start here.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#294bf3]">Founding Members</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This is the initial founding cohort of the Agile Architecture Lab.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Founding members receive:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg pl-6 list-disc marker:text-[#294bf3]">
          <li>lifetime access</li>
          <li>all future system additions</li>
          <li>every new walkthrough and framework as it is created</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Lab will later transition into a structured membership. Founding
          members keep permanent access.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          If you want to move beyond facilitating delivery and start designing
          how delivery actually runs, this is where that transition begins.
