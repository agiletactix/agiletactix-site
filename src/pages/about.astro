            From Theory-Focused to Technical
          </h3>

          <p>
            Like many of you, I started my agile journey learning the traditional frameworks—Scrum, SAFe, all the certifications. I facilitated ceremonies, coached teams, and preached the values and principles. But somewhere along the way, I realized something wasn't adding up.
          </p>

          <p>
            The agile professionals who were thriving weren't just the best facilitators or the ones with the most certifications. They were the ones who could actually deliver technical value—automate workflows, build dashboards, integrate tools, and solve real business problems beyond just "doing agile right."
          </p>

          <p>
            So I made a shift. I went deep on Jira—not just "how to create a board," but advanced automation, JQL analytics, workflow optimization, and integration strategies. I learned how to turn raw data into insights that leadership actually cared about. I became the person teams came to when they needed something built, not just facilitated.
          </p>

          <p>
            That shift changed everything. I went from being just another agile coach to being indispensable. And I'm still employed full-time, using these exact skills every day.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-sm text-gray-900">
            Why Traditional Training Wasn't Enough
          </h3>

          <p>
            As I developed my technical skills, I started teaching on Udemy. Over the years, I've trained 13,000+ professionals on Jira mastery—going far beyond the basics to show them how to become Jira power users and automation architects.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I kept seeing the same problem: talented agile professionals were getting left behind because the training industry was selling them outdated content. Large organizations like Scrum.org, Agile Alliance, and Scaled Agile were teaching the same generic theory to non-technical audiences, completely ignoring the AI revolution happening right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nobody was teaching agile professionals how to leverage AI agents in sprint planning. Nobody was showing them how to use Atlassian Rovo to transform their workflows. Nobody was preparing them for a future where "ceremony management" isn't enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's why I created AgileTactix.
